## Conclusion And Further Work
We have made a network for a small town. This network will upgrade the town's security and enhance the lifestyle of people. We have successfully implemented gate security, antitheft in banks, garage smoke detection and smoke controlling, home automation, automatic parking, smart garden monitoring, gate security, and maintaining a central data warehouse. Further smart traffic control can be integrated. Additionally, a smart emergency alert system that sends signals to hospitals and the fire brigade automatically can be developed.
